# leooconnell
- Yo! I'm Leo, and I am an intermediate programmer here on the Internet. I don't have many projects in the works at the moment.
- I plan on using GitHub as an educational tool at the moment, and possibly branch off further as I go.
- This is a fairly new account, but I originally joined GitHub over 2 years ago in 2020.

**Most, if not all code on my profile will be in the Lua or JS programming languages.**
