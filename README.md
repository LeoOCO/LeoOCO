# 🌆 leooconnell

- 👋 Yo! I'm Leo, and I am an intermediate programmer here on the Internet. I don't have many projects in the works at the moment.
- 📝 I plan on using GitHub as an educational tool at the moment, and possibly branch off further as I go.
- 💻 Currently trying to get better at coding in JavaScript, Lua, and HTML.
- ☑️ This is a fairly new account, but I originally joined GitHub over 2 years ago in 2020.

⚠️ **Most, if not all code on my profile will be in the Lua, JS, or Python programming languages.** Some may be in other commonly known languages, such as HTML.
